This session will introduce advocates to the technical tools needed to become a trusted authority for modeling potential changes to their state’s school funding formula. Participants will get a crash course in building data analysis and modeling skills, hear from other advocates who’ve put these skills to use to shape policy, and get to know colleagues across the Network who can support future funding reform efforts."
